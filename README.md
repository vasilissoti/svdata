svdata - Extract Specific Data From SystemVerilog
=================================================

This is intended to be a helper utility for tools which want to find specific
data, without having to parse a full AST.
Using this utility, specific data are extracted from a SystemVerilog
description and serialized to JSON, YAML, TOML, or similar.
